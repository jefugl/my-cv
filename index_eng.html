      <h2 class="intro-h2">About me</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a service-minded and social man of 52 years who lives
        in Oslo with my girlfriend and 2 bonus children. At work, I am structured,
        tidy, and engaged in what I do. I am independent and responsible in my
        work as well as I enjoy working with others. I am a willing to learn and
        a curious person who likes to find solutions and sees opportunities rather
        than limitations. I enjoy varied work tasks with elements of physical work.
        I have a large work capacity and are not afraid to dig in where and when
        it's needed, in the afternoon, evening, or weekend.</p>

      <h2 class="skills-h2">What I've been working on for the past few years</h2>
      <p class="skills">For the past 12 years, I have worked in the network
        department at Nordea Bank Norge ASA, where I have gained a lot of
        experience in network operation and maintenance. The environment I've
        worked towards is Cisco, LAN, WAN and WIFI, in the Nordic countries with
        the main emphasis on Norway. Since I have worked Nordic, I have used
        English orally and in writing every day. I have been involved in many
        projects with everything from ordering fiber connections to installing
        routers and switches at all locations in Nordea Norway.Design and install
        small wired and wireless network, implementation of security solutions on
        the network (Cisco Identity Service Engine) and responsible for upgrading
